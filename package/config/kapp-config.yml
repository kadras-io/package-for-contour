#! Rebase rules explicitly define how kapp should merge resources during an update.
#! See more about the resource merge method: https://carvel.dev/kapp/docs/latest/merge-method.
rebaseRules:

#! Specify which fields should be removed before diff-ing against last applied resource.
#! See more: https://carvel.dev/kapp/docs/latest/config/#diffagainstlastappliedfieldexclusionrules
diffAgainstLastAppliedFieldExclusionRules:

#! Each cloud provider will add its own custom annotations to the Envoy Service in order
#! to configure the associated load balancer. We want to keep those annotations between
#! upgrades, so we exclude them from the diff to prevent them being overwritten.
